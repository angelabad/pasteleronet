<p>
Many of us are familiar with the use of Apache for hosting
websites. It might not be the fastest webserver but it is
extraordinarily popular, extremely flexible, and a great choice for
most people. However there are times when it can struggle, and placing
a proxy in front of it can be useful. 
</p>

<p>
nginx is a very small, fast, and efficient HTTP server with a lot of
built in smarts to allow it to work as a reverse proxy, and not just
for HTTP, it also supports SMTP. 
</p>

<p>
I've recently updated this site to change the way it works - as it has
been struggling - and this brief introduction is mostly the
documentation on the changes I made. 
</p>

<p>
The site itself, like many, is made up of a mixture of static
resources and dynamically generated content. In our case our dynamic
content is produced a collection of Perl CGI scripts. The changes
described in this brief introduction to using nginx would apply to any
site that had a mixture of static & dynamic resources, so could apply
equally well to a Ruby on Rails or PHP-based site. 
</p>

<p>
Over the past couple of years I've noticed that Apache 2.x would
perform well on an average day, but start to struggle and perform less
well when under load. Apart from adding more memory to this host I
wanted to change the setup to increase the number of connections and
hits it could withstand. 
</p>

<p>
My plan was:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leave Apache's configuration as untouched as possible.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In case there were problems I wanted to be able to revert
          any changes easily.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Leave Apache to serve all the dynamic content as it did
      currently.</li>
  <li>Place a dedicated smaller, faster, and simpler HTTP server to
      serve static resources.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>With the expectation that this would leave Apache to handle
          the rest of the traffic which it would be able to do without being
          so distracted.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
There are a several ways this plan could have been executed and the
two most obvious were:
</p>

<h3>Shifting Resources Elsewhere</h3>

<p>
We could split the serving of static resources by moving them. For
example rather than serving and hosting
http://www.debian-administration.org/images/logo.png we could move
that to a different domain, such as
http://images.debian-administration.org/logo.png.
</p>

<p>
We could have created another sub-domain "static." to host any other
content, such as CSS and Javascript files.
</p>

<p>
This would allow us to easily configure a second webserver to handle
the static content (perhaps on a different host, but most likely on
the same one). The downside to this approach would be the required
updates to our site code, templates, and other files.
</p>


<h3>Introduce A Proxy</h3>

<p>
To avoid moving resources around, and the overhead this would entail,
the most simple solution would be to place a proxy in front of
Apache. This would examine the incoming HTTP request and dispatch it
to either:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apache if it were a request for /cgi-bin/</li>
  <li>Another dedicated server for all static resources (e.g. *.gif,
  *.png)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The decision to use nginx was pretty simple, there are a few different
proxies out there which are well regarded (including pound which we've
previously introduced for simple load-balancing). nginx looked like
the most likely candidate because it focuses upon being both a fast
HTTP server and a proxy.
</p>

<p>
By working as a proxy and a HTTP server this cuts down the software we
must use. Had we chosen a dedicated proxy-only tool we'd have needed
to have three servers running:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The proxy to receive requests.<li>
  <ul>
    <li>Apache2 for serving the dynamic content.</li>
    <li>HTTP server for static content.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
With nginx in place we have a simpler setup with only two servers running:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    nginx to accept requests and immediately serve static content.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Apache to receive the dynamic requests that nginx didn't want to
      handle.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Installing nginx</h3>

<p>
The installation of nginx was as simple as we'd expect upon a Debian
GNU/Linux host:
</p>

<pre>
# aptitude install nginx
</pre>

<p>
Once installed the configuration files are all be located beneath
the directory /etc/nginx. As with the Debian apache2 packages
you're expected to place sites you'd like to be enabled into
configuration files beneath a sites-enabled directory.
</p>

<p>
We'll not dwell on the nginx configuration files too much - the
main one is /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and is pretty readable and
sensible. The only change we need to make is to remove the file
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.
</p>

<h3>Configuring nginx & apache2</h3>

<p>
Configuring nginx itself is very simple, and our actual setup will
consist of two parts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Configuring nginx to listen upon port 80, and forward some
    requests to Apache.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changing the Apache configuration so that it no longer
    listens upon *:80, instead another port will be used.
  </li>

<p>
Our site is comprised of two virtual hosts our main main, and our
planet. The latter site is by far the most simple one as it has no
dynamic component to it, merely static files.
</p>

<p>
The setup of the static site consists of creating a configuration
file for it at /etc/nginx/sites-available/planet.conf with the
following content:
</p>

<pre>
#
#  planet-debian-administration.org is 100% static, so nginx can
# serve it all directly.
#
server {
       listen :80;

       server_name  planet.debian-administration.org;

       access_log   /home/www/planet.debian-administration.org/logs/access.log;

       root         /home/www/planet.debian-administration.org/htdocs/;
}
</pre>

<p>
This is sufficient for nginx to serve the virtual host
planet.debian-administration.org from the directory
/home/www/planet.debian-administration.org/htdocs - and log
incoming requests to an appropriate file.
</p>

<p>
The dynamic handling of our main site is a little more
complex. The contents of the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/d-a.conf
configuration file I came up with look like this:
</p>

<pre>
#
#  This configuration file handles our main site - it attempts to
# serve content directly when it is static, and otherwise pass to
# an instance of Apache running upon 127.0.0.1:8080.
#
server {
       listen :80;

       server_name  www.debian-administration.org debian-administration.org;
       access_log  /var/log/nginx/d-a.proxied.log;

       #
       # Serve directly:  /images/ + /css/ + /js/
       #
       location ^~ /(images|css|js) {
               root   /home/www/www.debian-administration.org/htdocs/;
               access_log  /var/log/nginx/d-a.direct.log ;
       }

       #
       # Serve directly: *.js, *.css, *.rdf,, *.xml, *.ico, & etc
       #
       location ~* \.(js|css|rdf|xml|ico|txt|gif|jpg|png|jpeg)$ {
               root   /home/www/www.debian-administration.org/htdocs/;
               access_log  /var/log/nginx/d-a.direct.log ;
       }

       #
       # Proxy all remaining content to Apache
       #
       location / {

           proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
           proxy_redirect     off;

           proxy_set_header   Host             $host;
           proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

           client_max_body_size       10m;
           client_body_buffer_size    128k;

           proxy_connect_timeout      90;
           proxy_send_timeout         90;
           proxy_read_timeout         90;

           proxy_buffer_size          4k;
           proxy_buffers              4 32k;
           proxy_busy_buffers_size    64k;
           proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;
       }
}

</pre>

<p>
This configuration file has several points of interest, but for
full details you'll need to consult the nginx documentation. The
most obvious sections of interest are the rules which determine
which content is handled directly by nginx.
</p>

<p>
You'll see that we have two different rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A rule which says anything beneath /images should be handled
    directly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another rule which says regardless of location *.png will always
    be handled directly.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These rules might seem redundant but it is better to be explicit about
our intentions. The rest of the file contains settings for the
forwarding of all other requests to the local Apache instance - I made
no changes to the sample configuration here.
</p>

<p>
The other point to note is that I log incoming requests to two files,
depending on whether they were proxied to our Apache instance or
handled directly. This isn't really required but it gives an idea of
which requests are going where.
</p>

<p>
With these two configuration files in place we're almost done, we just
need to ensure that Apache is no longer going to claim port 80 as its
own. We do this by modifying /etc/apache2/ports.conf to read:
</p>

<pre>
NameVirtualHost *:8080
Listen 8080

<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    # SSL name based virtual hosts are not yet supported, therefore no
    # NameVirtualHost statement here
    Listen 443
</IfModule>
</pre>

<p>
This will ensure that Apache binds to port 8080 and not port 80. We
then make matching changes to our virtual host files. For example
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/debian-administration.org:
</p>

<pre>
#  Debian Administration domain.
#
<VirtualHost *:8080>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@debian-administration.org
        ServerName www.debian-administration.org
        DirectoryIndex index.cgi index.html

        DocumentRoot /home/www/www.debian-administration.org/htdocs/
        ...
        ...
</pre>

<p>
With these changes in place we can switch to using our proxy:
</p>

<pre>
/etc/init.d/apache2 stop
/etc/init.d/nginx start
/etc/init.d/apache2 start
</pre>

<p>
(We stop apache2 so that port 80 becomes available, then start nginx
which will use that port, and finally restart apache2 so that it will
be available on port 8080 such that nginx can talk to it.)
</p>

<p>
Note: In this example Apache is listening on port 8080 on all IPs
rather than just 127.0.0.1:8080 - I later changed this.
</p>

<h3>Problems Experienced</h3>

<p>
Once deployed there were two problems which were initially
apparent:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Lack of IPv6 support.
  </li>
  <li>
    Incorrect IP addresses being logged.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately the version of nginx available in the Lenny release
of Debian did not contain any IPv6 support - which was a real
shame as we've been running upon IPv6 for quite some time
now. (About 3% of our visitors use native IPv6, including myself,
and I didn't want to lose them.)
</p>

<p>
The solution to the IPv6 problem was to backport the package
available in Debian's unstable distribution (a painless
process). Once this was done the nginx configuration file could be
updated to read:

<pre>
# Listen on both IPv6 & IPv4.
listen [::]:80;
</pre>

<p>
The second problem was related to how Apache received all
connections from the outside world via our local host via
nginx. This meant it would believe each incoming request was made
from the IP address 127.0.0.1.
</p>

<p>
Happily there was a very simple solution to this problem, the
libapache2-mod-rpaf module for Apache 2.x which will allow the
real IP address to be visible to our side, and the logfiles.
</p>

<p>
The RPAF module takes the IP address which initiated the original
connection, and which nginx placed in a X-Forwarded-For header,
and ensures this IP address is available to our dynamic scripts &
apache logfiles.
</p>

<p>
Applying this solution was as simple as:
</p>

<pre>
aptitude install libapache2-mod-rpaf
a2enmod rpaf
/etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload
</pre>

<p>
Once this was done our incoming connections were logged correctly,
and our code would see the real IP address for each connection
rather than the loopback address of the proxy host.
</p>

<h3>Potential Changes</h3>

<p>
As you can see from the posted configuration files all incoming
requests on port 80 will be either handled directly or proxied -
but I made no changes to the handling of port 443, or SSL
requests.
</p>

<p>
We've offered SSL for a significant length of time but few
visitors use it, so I elected to leave this setup as-is.
</p>

<p>
If the situation changes then nginx will be updated to proxy SSL
requests too - it has support for this, as a perusal of the
documentation will suggest.
</p>

<p>
So far it is too early to tell if this solution has increased our
scalability, but I'm very optimistic. Resource usage has certainly
fallen and the combination of nginx and apache is a good one that
isn't too complex.
</p>
